WOOMERA Channel Driver for Asterisk and CallWeaver
==================================================

Descripton:

Woomera is an abstracted VoIP protocol used as middleware
to cross connect disparate VoIP protocols.

Woomera channel driver is used to connect a PBX to
an external VoIP Protocol/Stack.

Eg:
	Open Source PBX
	---------------
	      	woomera client <----TCP/IP-----> woomera server + SIP --> Internet

	Open Source PBX
	---------------
		woomera client <----TCP/IP-----> woomera server + TDM/SS7/PRI/BRI


As the above diagram states, the Woomera Channel Driver implements the
Woomera Client portion of the Woomera Protocol.  The woomera server
is responsible for connecting the woomera client to a VoIP protocol such
as SIP, TDM/PRI/BRI/SS7.  

The PBX has no idea that its talking to an external VoIP protocol.
The only thing PBX understands is that incoming call arrived on
woomera channel, or place a call on an outgoing woomera channel.
All the Protocol/Stack logic is done on the woomera server.

Compilation:

	#> make
	#> make install

	Options:  PBXDIR=<absolute path to pbx source>

		  By default PBXDIR=/usr/src/asterisk
eg:
	#> make PBXDIR=/usr/src/asterisk1.4
	#> make PBXDIR=/usr/src/callweaver


Makefile will remember the PBXDIR path in local .pbxdir file.
From then on there is no need to pass in the PBXDIR 
parameter.

eg: 	make PBXDIR=/usr/src/asterisk1.4
	make
	
The second make will know that PBXDIR=/usr/src/asterisk1.4
Each time one passes PBXDIR to makefile the local ".pbxdir"
file will be updated
