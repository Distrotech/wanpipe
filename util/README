Environment Specific Information
--------------------------------

REDHAT
------

All utilities come pre-compiled with RedHat glib6
libraries. Therefore, if one is running RedHat no 
compilation is necessary. Utilities should be executed 
from /usr/sbin directory.


OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS
-------------------

If one is running on a NON RedHat distribution with 
different libraries, the configurator binaries might
fail. In this case, one can recompile all configurator
utilities by running 'make' from wanpipe/config
directory.

Before recompiling utilities, read the:

wanpipe/config/ft1/REAMDE file.
wanpipe/config/wancfg/README file.
 

To compile configurator utilities:

1. Change directory to wanpipe/config
2. Run 'make'
