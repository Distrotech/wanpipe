WANCFG : WANPIPE(tm) Configuration Utility
==========================================


Requirements
------------

1) The wancfg utility requires bash version 2.0 or 
   greater.  Please install the new bash version
   before proceeding.

   The wancfg utility requires the /bin/bash2 executable.
         

2) Wancfg also uses the lxdialog GUI libraries.  The lxdialog
   libraries depend on the following:

        i) libtermcap-devel-2.0.8-13, or greater
       ii) ncurses-devel-4.2-18, or greater

    Note: These packages are usually installed by default
          on Linux systems.
	
    The above packages can be found on the Sangoma ftp site:
    ftp.sangoma.com: in  /linux/lib/ directory.    


Compiling Utilities
-------------------

The "./wanpipe/Setup compile" will compile
all utilites and setup all environment options. If you
need to compile each utility separately do the
following:


1)  Change directory to ./wanpipe/config
    run 'make'

    If the make fails, please check that you have all ncurses
    libraries installed, refer to above section.


2)  Once all libraries are compiled you are ready to start the
    wancfg utility.

3)  run '/usr/sbin/wancfg'


Note: 'wancfg' must be run for each wanpipe#.conf file.
