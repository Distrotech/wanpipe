BISYCN API Package
==================

The sdlc package contains the sample sdlc client 
program that should be used in user application
development.


Contents of the API Package
---------------------------

 1) sdlc_api.c :  A sample API utility, that will send and receive
                  data packets across a sdlc line.  This program
		  should be used as a starting point in developing
		  a real-world sdlc application.


		  Development Note:

			  SDLC driver only supports single socket interface
			  for multiple SDLC channels. 

			  This complicates the TX part of the application.
			  Application MUST enable its own Tx delay in order
			  to throttle the tx data. 

			  Since single socket is provided, for multiple
			  SDLC channels, one can only have TWO processes,
			  one for Tx and other for Rx paths.  
			  Thus, TX throttling problem cannot be solved by 
			  just using multiple processes.

			  The sdlc_api implements tx throttling :)

		  Note: wanpipe1.conf interface (eg: sdlc0) must
		        be configured for API mode.



Usage: sdlc_api <router name> <interface name> <num of stations>

   eg: sdlc_api wanpipe1 sdlc0 2

       Tx/Rx data on Station Station 1 and 2 

       To enable Tx send a SIGUSR1 signal to sdlc_api
       kill -SIGUSR1 $(pidof sdlc_api) or run ./tx_test
