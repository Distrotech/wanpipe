The x25api package contains the sample client and server 
programs which should be used in application
development.


Contents of the API Package
---------------------------

 1) pthread/server.c :  Mutli-Threaded server application using pthreads.  The Pthread
                        architecure should be used when dealing with large number
			of svcs. 

 2) server_v1.c :  	Multi-Process server application that waits for incoming calls.
                        Once a call is accepted, it starts transmitting data. 

 3) server_v2.c :       Single process server application that waits for incoming calls.
 			Once a call is accepted, it start tx/rx data.

 4) svc_client.c :	Client application that places calls. Application   
                        doesn't wait for a call to be established; thus, multiple
                        calls can be placed from a single process.

 5) pvc_client.c:	PVC Client/Server application. No call setup required, 
                        data is transmitted as soon as x25 link comes up.  

 6) debug.c:		Debugging application. It lists all active WANPIPE socks
                        and displays their state and % buffer usage.

 7) hdlc_client.c:	HDLC Client/Server application.  HDLC uses LAPB HDLC
                        protocol instead of full X25. A single PVC connection.
			In order to use the LAPB HDLC protocol, a LAPB option
                        must be turned on in the WANPIPE configuration file.
