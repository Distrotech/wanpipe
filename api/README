WANPIPE API SAMPLE PROGRAMS
===========================

Author: Nenad Corbic


This directory contains:

libsangoma: Unified Linux/Windows API library

libstelephony: Telephony API used for dtmf/callerid etc.

sample_c: C sample code that uses libsangoma

sample_cpp: C++ sample code that uses libsangoma + libstelephony

tdm_api: Old test applications based on libsangoma

legacy/ Old Legacy API

legacy/aft:
	Sample API aplications used on to of all AFT hardware.

legacy/mpapi/x25:	
	WANPIPE MAPI X25 API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid mpapi x25 api development,
        and initial testing.

legacy/fr:	
	WANPIPE Frame Relay API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid frame relay api development,
        and initial testing.

legacy/chdlc:	
	WANPIPE CHDLC API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid chlc api development,
        and initial testing.

legacy/bitstrm: 
	WANPIPE BitStreaming API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid bitstreaming api development,
        and initial testing.

legacy/bisync: 
	WANPIPE BiSync API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid BiSync api development,
        and initial testing.


Special Products
----------------

Note, driver for these products are not installed
by default. They must be specfined during the
installation process to the ./Setup script.


BiSync_strm: 
	WANPIPE BiSync Streaming API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid BiSync Streamin api development,
        and initial testing. Used specificly for NASDAQ feeds.

	eg: ./Setup install --protocol=BSCSTRM

SS7:	WANPIPE SS7 API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid ss7 api development,
        and initial testing.
	
	eg: ./Setup install --protocol=SS7

MPAPI:	WANPIPE Multi-Protocol API Stacks
        The MPAPI includes the Wanpipe X25/LapB kernel stack.
        These programs should be used for rapid X25API 
	development,and initial testing.  Furhtermore the kernel
	X25API stack can run on top of MP HDLC driver or MP Frame
	Relay driver, over PRI and SEC S514/S508 ports.


To compile all api sample programs:

1. Change directory to /etc/wanpipe/api
2. Run 'make'
